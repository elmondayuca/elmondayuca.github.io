YHLQMDLG - Bad Bunny
YHLQMDLG is a reggaeton and Latin trap album, that incorporates elements of reggae, bachata, dembow, rock, and R&B. Billboard described the album as an "old-school perreo, romantic reggaeton, and Latin trap with global appeal." It is a departure from Bad Bunny's Latin trap style showcased on his very beginnings and focuses more on fun, bouncy, and aggressive reggaeton beats and lyrics. Bad Bunny's vision for the album was for it to bring back the “glory days” of reggaeton, drawing inspiration from it, like the song “Safaera”, which is a heavy, 00's-inspired, beat switching described "reggaeton symphony", which features Puerto Rican duo Jowell y Randy and Nengo Flow. The album also features Latin trap sounds, incorporating the widely known 808 drum patterns, and both fun and aggressive melodies, such as in “Si Veo A Tu Mama”, which samples the bossa-nova classic "The Girl from Ipanema", featuring a sweet, Nintendo-ish keyboard sound, while the song “25/8” is an example of the dark, hard-hitting melodies that some of the trap songs in the record share.

The College Dropout - Kanye West
The College Dropout diverged from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical subjects for the lyrics. Throughout the album, West touches on a number of different issues drawn from his own experiences and observations, including organized religion, family, sexuality, excessive materialism, self-consciousness, minimum wage labor, institutional prejudice, and personal struggles. Music journalist Kelefa Sanneh wrote, "Throughout the album, Mr. West taunts everyone who didn't believe in him: teachers, record executives, police officers, even his former boss at the Gap". West explained, "My persona is that I'm the regular person. Just think about whatever you've been through in the past week, and I have a song about that on my album".

You Are Going To Hate This - The Frights
A hormonally charged garage-surf-punk mess of driving rhythms and reverb drenched riffs with 50’s rockabilly references as fresh as the faces of this San Diego band. It’s all held together by front man Mikey Carnevale’s vocals pivoting effortlessly from hook-up to breakup, from croon to wail. Fidlar’s Zac Carper handles production duties for the band’s dangerbird records debut You Are Going To Hate This, which brilliantly captures the unbridled energy of the Frights’ live shows while letting their exuberant dirty doo-wop shine.

Kids See Ghosts - Kanye West & Kid Cudi
According to Jordan Bassett of NME, Kids See Ghosts shows West and Cudi "catching up with the fragmented, fragile brand of hip-hop that they helped to shape", noting how "the ethereal, low-key beats" characterize the production. Christopher Thiessen of PopMatters called the tracks "brooding, somber, psychedelic", observing that they often make use of minor chords, while Rrampt. magazine's Andrew Johnston deemed it a "truly adventurous movement in progressive hip-hop", with its seven songs traversing "scatted freakouts, bangers, space odysseys, psychedelic soul, and dream pop".

The Slow Rush - Tame Impala
he Slow Rush was called "an extraordinarily detailed opus" that reaches into "specific corners of the past six decades": Philly soul, early prog, acid house, adult contemporary-R&B, and even Late Registration. Noted as more upbeat than Tame Impala's previous records, the album has touches of '90s English techno and soft rock. NPR noted: "Listen closely and you can pick up traces of Rick James, Paul McCartney and Wings, Ravel, Childish Gambino, Pink Floyd, Human League, Prince and on and on. [...] The post-psychedelic swirl of The Slow Rush registers as an organic blend, with the songs never feeling cluttered or too tightly scripted."

An Evening with Silk Sonic - Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak
An Evening with Silk Sonic has been described as an R&B, soul, funk, and pop album. In talking about the album's sound, The Ringer stated "though styled as a 1960s to '70s retro endeavor, Silk Sonic isn't a work of nostalgia but rather a fusion: funk, rap, and R&B as they've sounded in heavy rotation as recently as the 2000s." It is also a rap album.

Master of Puppets - Metallica
Master of Puppets features dynamic music and thick arrangements. Metallica delivered a more refined approach and performance compared to the previous two albums, with multilayered songs and technical dexterity. This album and its predecessor Ride the Lightning follow a similar track sequencing: both open with an up-tempo song with an acoustic intro, followed by a lengthy title track, and a fourth track with ballad qualities. Although both albums are similarly structured, the musicianship on Master of Puppets is more powerful and epic in scope, with tight rhythms and delicate guitar solos.

JackBoys - Jackboys & Travis Scott
